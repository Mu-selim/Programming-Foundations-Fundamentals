# Errors tend to fall into three categories:

# 1. Syntax, you somehow broke the rules of the language.
# Ex:
print(Hello All)


# 2. Runtime, the computer was unable to execute a portion of your code.
#Ex:
print(10 * (5/0))


# 3. Semantic, the output of the program is not what you expected
#Ex:
name = "Mohamad"
print("Hello name")
